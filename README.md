## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- map API by LeafletJs
- IP Geolocation API by abstract 


### What I learned

I learned a lot while building this app. I learned how to interact with remote API servers and how to populate the UI with incoming responses from servers. I have used a different API for tracking IP's than what was recommended by Frontend mentors. The API I used allows upto 10000 calls a month as opposed to only 1000 calls on the recommended one. Of course, I'm not sutisfied by this change for the API i used is less accurate when revealing locations.     

### Continued development

I hope to return to this app to make some search engine optimization to the code so users can easily discover it.
